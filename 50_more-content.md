placeholders and notes

## New project

Revisit and expand "GitHub first, then RStudio" example presented here.

## R Markdown + GitHub workflow

[Test drive R Markdown](block007_first-use-rmarkdown.html) but embrace the Git/GitHub aspects.

Push HTML and show how unsatisfactory that is. Push markdown and show how nice that is.

Optional: R script example and properly commented YAML.

## Existing project

~~Create an RStudio project, then make it a Git repo, then make a GitHub repo, then connect them.~~ *oh, let's not*

Easier though less elegant: create repo on GitHub, clone via RStudio, then copy your stuff in.

What if it's an existing project that is also a Git repo with a history you care about? Then you have to do it properly. Using the "RStudio first, then GitHub" template from here: [Test connection between RStudio and GitHub](git07_git-github-rstudio.html).

## Clone a project

For when you just want a copy of something. But also want to track its evolution, which would not be true if you just, say, downloaded the ZIP archive.

I create a repo (or use one created above). They clone. I make a new commit. They pull to get it.

More practice: Do this once with ... your favorite R package? The polygraphing film data (or something else that is not an R package)?

Need to explain when to do this versus fork.

How to keep a fork updated. The browser only method. The 2nd remote method.

## The repeated amend

local only, i.e. never amend a commit that's already pushed

affecting a remote, explain why so dangerous and when it *might* be ok

## Disaster recovery

Practice burn it all down.

Editing most recent commit or just its message.

Rebase avoidance techniques.

Headless state. Rebase hell.
