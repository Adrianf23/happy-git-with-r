## Clone a project

For when you just want a copy of something. But also want to track its evolution, which would not be true if you just, say, downloaded the ZIP archive.

I create a repo (or use one created above). They clone. I make a new commit. They pull to get it.

More practice: Do this once with ... your favorite R package? The polygraphing film data (or something else that is not an R package)?

Need to explain when to do this versus fork.

How to keep a fork updated. The browser only method. The 2nd remote method.

## git stuff

link out to full tutorials w/ good visuals

filesystem / working directory

vs

staging area

vs

???

make sure understand you can have a file locally that git is not tracking and is not pushing/pulling to github.  It's ok to not stage everything. If a long-term situation, gitignore so it doesn't clutter things up and bug you.

  * `git add -A` 

## The repeated amend

local only, i.e. never amend a commit that's already pushed

affecting a remote, explain why so dangerous and when it *might* be ok

## Disaster recovery

Break it down:

  * Is something wrong with my filesystem, files?
  * Is my git repo messed up?
  * How can I keep this from happening again?
  
Best case, you have no filesystem problem, only a git problem. And some sort of reset usually works.

Practice burn it all down.

Editing most recent commit or just its message.

Rebase avoidance techniques.

Headless state. Rebase hell.

Commiting things you didn't mean to (too big, secret)

Not being able to do something, like edit last commit (technically I wanted to do interactive rebase, in order to edit last commit w/o amending it), because of having unstaged changes.

## Engage with R source on GitHub

Browsing

Searching

  * My gist, re: the cran user: <https://gist.github.com/jennybc/4a1bf4e9e1bb3a0a9b56>
  * Recent search for roxygen template usage in the wild: <https://github.com/search?utf8=âœ“&q=man-roxygen+in:path&type=Code&ref=searchresults>

Being a useful useR

  * stay informed re: development
  * use issues for bug reports, feature requests
  * make pull requests
