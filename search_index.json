Why GitHub? 1.1 Why Git? 1.2 Why GitHub? 1.3 Is it going to hurt? 1.4 What is the payoff? 1.5 Who can do what? 1.6 Special features of GitHub 1.7 What’s special about using R and with Git and GitHub? 1.8 Audience and pre-reqs 1.9 What this is NOT", " 1 Why Git? Why GitHub? 1.1 Why Git? Git is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files – called a repository – in a sane, highly structured way. If you have no idea what I’m talking about, think of it as the “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word on steroids. Git has been re-purposed by the data science community. In addition to using it for source code, we use it to manage the motley collection of files that make up typical data analytical projects, which often consist of data, figures, reports, and, yes, source code. A solo data analyst, working on a single computer, will benefit from adopting version control. But not nearly enough to justify the pain of installation and workflow upheaval. There are much easier ways ways to get versioned back ups of your files, if that’s all you’re worried about. In my opinion, for new users, the pros of Git only outweigh the cons when you factor in the overhead of communicating and collaborating with other people. Who among us does not need to do that? Your life is much easier if this is baked into your workflow, as opposed to being a separate process that you dread or neglect. 1.2 Why GitHub? This is where hosting services like GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab come in. They provide a home for your Git-based projects on the internet. If you have no idea what I’m talking about, think of it as DropBox but much, much better. The remote host acts as a distribution channel or clearinghouse for your Git-managed project. It allows other people to see your stuff, sync up with you, and perhaps even make changes. These hosting providers improve upon traditional Unix Git servers with well-designed web-based interfaces. We target GitHub – not Bitbucket or GitLab – for the sake of specificity. However, all the big-picture principles and even some mechanics will carry over to these alternative hosting platforms. Don’t get too caught up on public versus private at this point. There are many ways to get private repositories from the major providers for low or no cost. Just get started and figure out if and how Git/GitHub is going to work for you! If you outgrow this arrangement, you can throw some combination of technical savvy and money at the problem. You can either pay for a higher level of service or self-host one of these platforms. 1.3 Is it going to hurt? You have to install Git, get local Git talking to GitHub, and make sure RStudio can talk to local Git (and, therefore, GitHub). This is one-time or once-per-computer pain. For new or existing projects, you will: Dedicate a directory (a.k.a “folder”) to it. Make it an RStudio Project. Make it a Git repository. Go about your usual business. But instead of only saving individual files, periodically you make a commit, which takes a multi-file snapshot of the entire project. Have you ever versioned a file by adding your initials or the date? That is effectively a commit, albeit only for a single file: it is a version that is significant to you and that you might want to inspect or revert to later. Push commits to GitHub periodically. This is like sharing a document with colleagues on DropBox or sending it out as an email attachment. It signals you’re ready to make your work visible to others and invite comment or edits. This is a change to your normal, daily workflow. It feels weird at first but quickly becomes second nature. FWIW, STAT 545 students are required to submit all coursework via GitHub. This is a major topic in class and office hours for the first two weeks. Then we practically never discuss it again. The rest of this site is dedicated to walking you through the necessary setup and creating your first few Git projects. We conclude with prompts that guide you through some of the more advanced usage that makes all of this initial pain worthwhile. 1.4 What is the payoff? If someone needs to see your work or if you want them to try out your code, they can easily get it from GitHub. If they use Git, then can clone or fork your repository. If they don’t use Git, they can still browse your project on GitHub like a normal website and even grab everything by downloading a zip archive. If you need to collaborate on data analysis or code development, then all involved should use Git. Use GitHub as your clearinghouse: individuals work independently, then send work back to GitHub for reconciliation and transmission to the rest of the team. If you care deeply about someone else’s project, such as an R package you use heavily, you can track its development on GitHub. You can watch the repository to get notified of major activity. You can fork it to keep your own copy. You can modify your fork to add features or fix bugs and send them back to the owner as a proposed change. 1.5 Who can do what? A public repository is readable by the world. The owner can grant higher levels of permission to others, such as the ability to push commits. A private repository is invisible to the world. The owner can grant read, write (push), or admin access to others. 1.6 Special features of GitHub this is perhaps too detailed … full stop? or does it belong elsewhere? In addition to a well-designed user interface, GitHub offers two especially important features: Issues. Remember how we’re high-jacking software development tools? Well, this is the bug tracker. It’s a list of things … bugs, feature requests, to do’s, whatever. Issues are tightly integrated with email and therefore allow you to copy/embed important conversations in the associated repo. Issues can be assigned to people (e.g., to do’s) and tagged (“bug” or “progress-report”). Issues are tightly integrated with commits and therefore allow you to record that the changes in this commit solve that problem which was discussed in that issue. As a new user of GitHub, one of the most productive things you can do is to use GitHub issues to provide a clear bug report or feature request for a package you use. Pull requests. Git allows a project to have multiple, independent branches of development, with the notion that some should eventually be merged back into the main development branch. These are technical Git terms but hopefully also make sense on their own. A pull request is a formal proposal that says: “Here are some changes I would like to make.” It might be linked to a specific issue: “Related to #14.” or “Fixes #56”. GitHub facilitates and preserves the discussion of the proposal, holistically and line-by-line. 1.7 What’s special about using R and with Git and GitHub? the active R package development community on GitHub workflows for R scripts and R Markdown files that make it easy to share source and rendered results on GitHub Git- and GitHub-related features of the RStudio IDE 1.8 Audience and pre-reqs The target audience for this site is someone who analyzes data, probably with R, though much of the content may be useful to analysts using other languages. While R package development with Git(Hub) is absolutely in scope, it’s not an explicit focus or requirement. The site is aimed at intermediate to advanced R users, who are comfortable writing R scripts and managing R projects. You should have a good grasp of files and directories and be generally knowledgeable about where things live on your computer. Although we will show alternatives for most Git operations, we will inevitably spend some time in the shell and we assume some prior experience. For example, you should know how to open up a shell, navigate to a certain directory, and list the files there. You should be comfortable using shell commands to view/move/rename files and to work with your command history. 1.9 What this is NOT We aim to teach novices about Git on a strict “need to know” basis. Git was built to manage development of the Linux kernel, which is probably very different from what you do. Most people need a small subset of Git’s functionality and that will be our focus. If you want a full-blown exposition of Git as a directed acyclic graph or a treatise on the Git-Flow branching strategy, you will be sad. "],

You cannot show up at 9am with no preparation and keep up! These are battle-tested instructions, so most will succeed. We believe in you! If you have trouble, you can open an issue here and we might be able to help in the days leading up to useR! (no promises). We will have TAs in Campbell Rehearsal Hall starting at 8:15am and throughout the workshop. Try this. Give it about 1 - 2 hours. If you hit a wall, we will help: Register a free GitHub account (chapter 5). Install or update R and RStudio (chapter 6). Install Git (chapter 7). Introduce yourself to Git (chapter 8). Prove local Git can talk to GitHub (chapter 10). Cache your username and password (chapter 11) or set up SSH keys (chapter 12) so you don’t need to authenticate yourself to GitHub interactively ad nauseum. Prove RStudio can find local Git and, therefore, can talk to GitHub (chapter 13). FYI: this is where our hands-on activities will start. We walk through a similar activity together, with narrative, and build from there. Troubleshooting: If RStudio is having a hard time finding Git, see chapter 14. For all manner of problems, both installation and usage related, see chapter 15. Optional reading on “big picture stuff”: Read “Why Git?

Except your username. You might want to give that some thought. A few tips, which sadly tend to contradict each other: Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember. Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that. Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss. Shorter is better than longer. Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames. Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence. Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming. In my first inept efforts to script around the GitHub API, I assigned lots of issues to the guy with username NA because my vector of GitHub usernames contained missing values.

["install-git.html", "7 Install Git 7.1 Git already installed? 7.2 Windows 7.3 Mac OS 7.4 Linux", " 7 Install Git You need Git, so you can use it at the command line and so RStudio can call it. If there’s any chance it’s installed already, verify that, rejoice, and skip this step. Otherwise, find installation instructions below for your operating system. 7.1 Git already installed? Go to the shell (chapter A) and enter which git and git --version: jenny@2015-mbp happy-git-with-r $ which git /usr/bin/git jenny@2015-mbp happy-git-with-r $ git --version git version 2.7.4 (Apple Git-66) If Git reports a path to an executable and a version, that’s great! You have Git already. No need to install! Move on. If, instead, you see something more like git: command not found, keep reading. Mac OS users might get an immediate offer to install command line developer tools. Yes, you should accept! Click “Install” and read more below. 7.2 Windows Option 1 (recommended): Install Git for Windows, previously known as msysgit or “Git Bash”, to get Git in addition to some other useful tools, such as the Bash shell. Yes, all those names are totally confusing. This approach leaves the Git executable in a conventional location, which will help you and other programs, e.g. RStudio, find it and use it. This also supports a transition to more expert use, because the Bash shell will be useful as you venture outside of R/RStudio. This also leaves you with a Git client, though not a very good one. So check out Git clients we recommend (chapter 9). Option 2 (NOT recommended): The GitHub hosting site offers GitHub Desktop for Windows that provides Git itself, a client, and smooth integration with GitHub. Their Windows set-up instructions recommend this method of Git installation. Why don’t we like it? We’ve seen GitHub Desktop for Windows lead to Git installation in suboptimal locations, such as ~/AppData/Local, and in other places we could never find. If you were only going to interact with GitHub via this app, maybe that’s OK, but that does not apply to you. Therefore, we recommend option 1 instead. 7.3 Mac OS Option 1 (highly recommended): Install the Xcode command line tools (not all of Xcode), which includes Git. Go to the shell and enter one of these commands to elicit an offer to install developer command line tools: git --version git config Accept the offer! Click on “Install”. Another way to request this is via xcode-select --install. We just happen to find this Git-based trigger apropos. Option 2 (recommended): Install Git from here: http://git-scm.com/downloads. This arguably sets you up the best for the future. It will certainly get you the latest version of Git of all approaches described here. The GitHub home for this project is here: https://github.com/timcharper/git_osx_installer. At that link, there is a list of maintained builds for various combinations of Git and Mac OS version. If you’re running 10.7 Lion and struggling, we’ve had success in September 2015 with binaries found here: https://www.wandisco.com/git/download. Option 3 (recommended): If you anticipate getting heavily into scientific computing, you’re going to be installing and updating lots of software. You should check out homebrew, “the missing package manager for OS X”. Among many other things, it can install Git for you. Once you have Homebrew installed, do this in the shell: brew install git Option 4 (NOT recommended): The GitHub hosting site offers GitHub Desktop for Mac that provides the option to install Git itself, a client, and smooth integration with GitHub.. Their Mac set-up instructions recommend this method of Git installation. We don’t like GitHub Desktop as a Git client, so this is a very cumbersome way to install Git. Consider this option a last resort. 7.4 Linux Install Git via your distro’s package manager.

["git-client.html", "9 Install a Git client 9.1 What and why 9.2 Recommended Git clients", " 9 Install a Git client This is optional but highly recommended. Unless specified, it is not required for live workshops and will not be explicitly taught, though you might see us using one of these clients. 9.1 What and why Learning to use version control can be rough at first. I found the use of a GUI – as opposed to the command line – extremely helpful when I was getting started. I call this sort of helper application a Git client. It’s really a Git(Hub) client because they also help you interact with GitHub or other remotes. Git and your Git client are not the same thing, just like R and RStudio are not the same thing. A Git client and the RStudio IDE are not necessary to use to Git or R, respectively, but they make the experience more pleasant because they reduce the amount of command line bullshittery. RStudio offers a very basic Git client. I use this often for simple operations, but you probably want another, more powerful one as well. Fair warning: for some things, you will have to use the command line. But the more powerful your Git client is, the less often this happens. Fantastic news: because all of the clients are just forming and executing Git commands on your behalf, you don’t have to pick one. You can literally do one operation from the command line, do another from RStudio, and another from SourceTree, one after the other, and it just works. Very rarely, both clients will scan the repo at the same time and you’ll get an error message about .git/index.lock. Try the operation again at least once before doing any further troubleshooting. 9.2 Recommended Git clients SourceTree is a free, powerful Git(Hub) client that I highly recommend. It was my first Git client and is still my favorite for nontrivial Git tasks. Available for Mac and Windows. If I’m teaching you in a course or workshop, you might see me using this. GitKraken is quite new on the scene and is free. I would probably start here if I was starting today. Why? Because it works across all three OSes my students use: Windows, Mac, and Linux. I hear very good reviews, especially from long-suffering Linux users who haven’t had any great options until now. GitUp is a free, open source client for Mac OS. I’ve heard really good things about it and like what I read on the website. However, I tried to make myself use it for a day and went sort of nuts, possibly because I’m so used to SourceTree. YMMV. GitHub also offers a free Git(Hub) client for Windows and Mac. We do NOT recommend it for Windows and have serious reservations even for Mac OS. What do we object to? The degree of hand-holding offered by GitHub’s clients borders on hand-cuffs. The Windows client sometimes leaves the Git executable so well hidden that we can’t find it. This is a deal-killer, because that means RStudio can’t find it either. These clients wrap Git functionality so thoroughly that we’ve had students make some destructive mistakes. For example, we’ve seen a “sync” operation that resulted in the loss of local uncommitted changes. Exactly which Git operations, in what order, are implied by “sync”, is not entirely clear. We prefer clients that expose Git more explicitly. We’ve heard similar negative reviews from other instructors. It’s not just us. Others that I have heard positive reviews for: SmartGit git-cola magit, for Emacs nerds Browse even more Git(Hub) clients. "],

Clone myrepo from GitHub to your computer. This URL should have your GitHub username and the name of your practice repo.

I assume we’re still viewing your new GitHub repo. Refresh. You should see the new “A line I wrote on my local computer” in the README. If you click on “commits,” you should see one with the message “A commit from my local computer.” If you have made it this far, you are ready to graduate to using Git and GitHub with RStudio (chapter 13). But first … 10.5 Am I really going to type GitHub username and password on each push? It is likely that your first push, above, leads to a challenge for your GitHub username and password. This will drive you crazy in the long-run and make you reluctant to push. Do one of the follow to eliminate this annoyance: Credential caching for HTTPS access, chapter 11. Set up SSH keys, chapter 12. Now is the perfect time to do this, since you have a functioning test repo. 10.6 Clean up Local When you’re ready to clean up, you delete the local repo any way you like. It’s just a regular directory on your computer.

I do not explain all the shell and Git commands in detail. This is a black box diagnostic / configuration exercise. 11.1 Get a test repository You need a functioning test Git repository. One that exists locally and remotely on GitHub, with the local repo tracking the remote. If you have just verified that you can interact with GitHub (chapter 10) from your local computer, that test repo will be perfect. If you have just verified that you can work with GitHub from RStudio (chapter 13), that test repo will also be perfect. You may proceed when You have a test repo. You know where it lives on your local computer. Example: /home/jenny/tmp/myrepo You know where it lives on GitHub. Example: https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo You know local is tracking remote. In a shell with working directory set to the local Git repo, enter: git remote -v Output like this confirms that fetch and push are set to remote URLs that point to your GitHub repo: origin https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo (fetch) origin https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo (push) Now enter: git branch -vv Here we confirm that the local master branch has your GitHub master branch (origin/master) as upstream remote. Gibberish? Just check that your output looks similar to mine: master b8e03e3 [origin/master] line added locally 11.2 Verify that your Git is new enough to have a credential helper In a shell, do: git --version and verify your version is 1.7.10 or newer. If not, update Git (chapter 7) or use SSH keys (chapter 12). 11.3 Turn on the credential helper 11.3.0.1 Windows In the shell, enter: git config --global credential.helper wincred 11.3.0.2 Windows, plan B If that doesn’t seem to work, install an external credential helper. Download the git-credential-winstore.exe application. Run it! It should work if Git is in your PATH environment variable. If not, go to the directory where you downloaded the application and run the following: git-credential-winstore -i &quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin\\git.exe&quot; 11.3.0.3 Mac Find out if the credential helper is already installed. In the shell, enter: git credential-osxkeychain And look for this output: usage: git credential-osxkeychain &lt;get|store|erase&gt; If you don’t get this output, it means you need a more recent version of Git, either via command line developer tools or homebrew. Go back to the Mac section of chapter (7). Once you’ve confirmed you have the credential helper, enter: git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain 11.3.0.4 Linux In the shell, enter: git config --global credential.helper &#39;cache --timeout=10000000&#39; to store your password for ten million seconds or around 16 weeks, enough for a semester. 11.3.1 Trigger a username / password challenge Change a file in your local repo and commit it. Do that however you wish. Here are shell commands that will work: echo &quot;adding a line&quot; &gt;&gt; README.md git add -A git commit -m &quot;A commit from my local computer&quot; Now push! git push -u origin master One last time you will be asked for your username and password, which hopefully will be cached. Now push AGAIN. git push You should NOT be asked for your username and password, instead you should see Everything up-to-date. Rejoice and close the shell. "],

Assuming that you’ve gotten local Git to talk to GitHub, this means you’ll also be able to pull from and push to GitHub from RStudio. In later chapters and in live workshops˜, we revisit these operations with much more explanation. If you succeed here, your set up is DONE. 13.1 Prerequisites We assume the following: You’ve registered a free GitHub account (chapter 5). You’ve installed/updated R and RStudio (chapter 6). You’ve installed Git (chapter 7). You’ve introduced yourself to Git (chapter 8). You’ve confirmed that you can push to / pull from GitHub from the command line (chapter 10). 13.2 Make a new repo on GitHub Go to https://github.com and make sure you are logged in. Click green “New repository” button. Or, if you are on your own profile page, click on “Repositories”, then click the green “New” button. Repository name: myrepo (or whatever you wish, we will delete this) Public YES Initialize this repository with a README Click big green button “Create repository.” Copy the HTTPS clone URL to your clipboard via the green “Clone or Download” button. Or copy the SSH URL if you chose to set up SSH keys. 13.3 Clone the new GitHub repository to your computer via RStudio In RStudio, start a new Project: File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git. In the “repository URL” paste the URL of your new GitHub repository. It will be something like this https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo.git. Do you NOT see an option to get the Project from Version Control? Go to chapter 14 for tips on how to help RStudio find Git. Take charge of – or at least notice! – the local directory for the Project. A common rookie mistake is to have no idea where you are saving files or what your working directory is. Pay attention. Be intentional. Personally, I would do this in ~/tmp. I suggest you check “Open in new session”, as that’s what you’ll usually do in real life. Click “Create Project”. This should download the README.md file that we created on GitHub in the previous step. Look in RStudio’s file browser pane for the README.md file. 13.4 Make local changes, save, commit From RStudio, modify the README.md file, e.g., by adding the line “This is a line from RStudio”. Save your changes. Commit these changes to your local repo. How? From RStudio: Click the “Git” tab in upper right pane. Check “Staged” box for README.md. If you’re not already in the Git pop-up, click “Commit”. Type a message in “Commit message”, such as “Commit from RStudio”. Click “Commit”. 13.5 Push your local changes online to GitHub Click the green “Push” button to send your local changes to GitHub. If you are challenged for username and password, provide them (but see below). You should see some message along these lines. [master dc671f0] blah 3 files changed, 22 insertions(+) create mode 100644 .gitignore create mode 100644 myrepo.Rproj 13.6 Confirm the local change propagated to the GitHub remote Go back to the browser. I assume we’re still viewing your new GitHub repo. Refresh. You should see the new “This is a line from RStudio” in the README. If you click on “commits,” you should see one with the message “Commit from RStudio”. If you have made it this far, you are DONE with set up. But first … 13.7 Were you challenged for GitHub username and password? If you somehow haven’t done so yet, now is the perfect time to make sure you don’t need to keep providing username and password on each push. Pick one: Credential caching for HTTPS access, chapter 11. Set up SSH keys, chapter 12. Now is the perfect time to do this, since you have a functioning test repo. 13.8 Clean up Local When you’re ready to clean up, you delete the local repo any way you like. It’s just a regular directory on your computer. GitHub In the browser, go to your repo’s landing page on GitHub. Click on “Settings”. Scroll down, click on “delete repository,” and do as it asks. "],

This often “just works”, so this page is aimed at people who have reason to suspect they have a problem. This is something you set up once-per-computer. 14.1 Do you have a problem? Let’s check if RStudio can find the Git executable. File &gt; New Project… Do you see an option to create from Version Control? If yes, good. Select New Directory &gt; Empty Project. Do you see a checkbox “Create a git repository”? If yes, good, CHECK IT. Give this disposable test project a name and click Create Project. Do you see a “Git” tab in the upper right pane, the same one that has “Environment” and “History”? If yes, good. If all looks good, you can delete this project. Looks like RStudio and Git are talking to each other. Keep reading if things don’t go so well or you want to know more. 14.2 Find Git yourself RStudio can only act as a GUI front-end for Git if Git has been successfully installed (chapter 7) AND RStudio can find it. A basic test for successful installation of Git is to simply enter git in the shell. If you get a complaint about Git not being found, it means installation was unsuccessful or that it is not being found, i.e. it is not on your PATH. If you are not sure where the Bit executable lives, try this in a shell: which git (Mac, Linux) where git (most versions of Windows) 14.3 Tell RStudio where to find Git If Git appears to be installed and findable, launch RStudio. Quit and re-launch RStudio if there’s any doubt in your mind about whether you opened RStudio before or after installing Git. Don’t make me stop this car and restart RStudio for you in office hours. DO IT. From RStudio, go to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Git/SVN and make sure that the box Git executable points to … the Git executable. It should read something like: /usr/bin/git (Mac, Linux) C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/bin/git.exe (Windows) Here is a screenshot of someone doing this on a Windows machine. WARNING: On Windows, do NOT use C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/cmd/git.exe. bin is GOOD YES! cmd is BAD NO! At times, we’ve had trouble navigating to the necessary directory on Mac OS, once we’ve clicked “Browse” and are working with a Finder-type window. The keyboard shortcut “command + shift + g” will summon “Go To Folder”, where you will be able type or paste any path you want. Restart RStudio if you make any changes. Don’t make me stop this car again and restart RStudio for you in office hours. DO IT. Do the steps at the top of the page to see if RStudio and git are communicating now. No joy? I’ve seen this help: With your Project open, go to Tools &gt; Project Options.... If available, click on “Git/SVN” and select “Git” in the Version control system dropdown menu. Answer “yes” to the “Confirm New Git Repository” pop up. Answer “yes” to the “Confirm Restart RStudio” pop up.

If you experience some new problem and, especially, find the corresponding solution, we’d love to hear from you! 15.1 I think I have installed Git but damn if I can find it When you install Git, try to control or record where it is being installed! Make a mental or physical note of these things. You may be able to find Git after the fact with these commands in the shell: which git (Mac, Linux, or anything running a bash shell) where git (Windows, when not in a bash shell) It is not entirely crazy to just re-install Git, using a method that leaves it in a more conventional location, and to pay very close attention to where it’s being installed. Live and learn. 15.2 Dysfunctional PATH I’m pretty sure that most cases of RStudio not automatically detecting the Git executable stem from problems with PATH. This is the set of directories where your computer will look for executables, such as Git (today) or make (later in this course). Certain methods of Git installation, especially on Windows and/or older OSes, have a higher tendency to put Git in an unconventional location or to fail to add the relevant directory to PATH. How to see your PATH? In the shell: echo $PATH Take a good hard look at this. See the point above about finding your Git executable or re-installing it while you are wide awake. Is the host directory in your PATH? No? Fix that. Go here for instructions on what to put in your .bash_profile in order to add a directory to PATH. 15.3 Push/Pull buttons greyed out in RStudio Are you sure your local repository is tracking a remote repository, e.g. a GitHub repo? In a shell with working directory set to the local Git repo, enter these commands: jenny@2015-mbp myrepo $ git remote -v origin https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo (fetch) origin https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo (push) jenny@2015-mbp myrepo $ git branch -vv * master b8e03e3 [origin/master] line added locally We want to see that fetch and push are set to remote URLs that point to the remote repo. We also want to see that your local master branch has your GitHub master branch as upstream remote. If you discover you still need to set a remote, go to the shell and get into the working directory of the RStudio Project and Git repo of interest. Initiate the “upstream” or “tracking” relationship by adding a remote. Substitute the HTTPS URL for your GitHub repo. git remote add origin https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo.git Download all the files from the online GitHub repository and deal with any conflicts. git pull origin master Cement the tracking relationship between your GitHub repository and the local repo by pushing and setting the “upstream” remote: git push -u origin master 15.4 I have no idea if my local repo and my remote repo are connected. See the above section on “Push/Pull buttons greyed out in RStudio.” 15.5 Push fail at the RStudio level Do you get this error in RStudio? error: unable to read askpass response from &#39;rpostback-askpass&#39; Open the shell: Tools &gt; Shell. git push -u origin master 15.6 Push rejected, i.e. fail at the Git/GitHub level You might have changes on the remote AND on your local repo. Just because you don’t remember making any edits in the browser doesn’t mean you didn’t. Humor me. Pull first. Resolve any conflicts. Then try your push again. 15.7 RStudio is not making certain files available for staging/commiting Do you have a space in your directory or file names? A space in a file name is a space in your soul. Get rid of it. Is your Git repo / RStudio Project inside a folder that … eventually rolls up to Google Drive, DropBox, Microsoft OneDrive, or a network drive? If yes, I recommend you move the repo / Project into a plain old directory that lives directly on your computer and that is not managed by, e.g., Google Drive. If you cannot deal with the two root causes identified above, then it is possible that a more powerful Git client (chapter 9) will be able to cope with these situations. But I make no promises. You should also try Git operations from the command line. 15.8 I hear you have some Git repo inside your Git repo Do not create a Git repository inside another Git repository. Just don’t. If you have a genuine need for this, which is really rare, the proper way to do is is via submodules. In STAT 545, we certainly do not need to do this and when we’ve seen it, it’s been a mistake. This has resulted in the unexpected and complete loss of the inner Git repository. To be sure, there was more going on here (cough, GitHub Desktop client), but non-standard usage of Git repos makes it much easier to make costly mistakes. "],

["shell.html", "A The shell A.1 What is the shell? A.2 Starting the shell A.3 Using the shell", " A The shell Even if you do most of your Git operations via a client, such as RStudio or GitKraken, you must sometimes work in the shell. As you get more comfortable with Git, you might prefer to do more and more via the command line. A.1 What is the shell? The shell (or bash or terminal) is a program on your computer whose job is to run other programs, rather than do calculations itself. The shell is a very old program and in a time before the mouse it was the only way to interact with a computer. It is still extremely popular among programmers because it is very fast, concise, and is particularly powerful at automating repetitive tasks. Here we use the shell for quite modest goals: to navigate the file system, confirm the present working directory, configure Git, and configure Git remotes. A.2 Starting the shell In RStudio, go to Tools &gt; Shell. This should take you to the shell (on Mac: Terminal, on Windows: GitBash or equivalent). It should be a simple blinking cursor, waiting for input and look similar to this (white text on black background, or black text on white background): A.3 Using the shell The most basic commands are listed below: pwd (print working directory). Shows directory or “folder” you are currently operating in. This is not necessarily the same as the R working directory you get from getwd(). ls (list files). Shows the files in the current working directory. This is equivalent to looking at the files in your Finder/Explorer/File Manager. Use ls -a to also list hidden files, such as .Rhistory and .git. cd (change directory). Allows you to navigate through your directories by changing the shell’s working directory. You can navigate like so: go to subdirectory foo of current working directory: cd foo go to parent of current working directory: cd .. go to your “home” directory: cd ~ or simply cd go to directory using absolute path, works regardless of your current working directory: cd /home/my_username/Desktop. Windows uses a slightly different syntax with the slashes between the folder names reversed, \\, e.g. cd C:\\Users\\MY_USERNAME\\Desktop. Pro tip 1: Dragging and dropping a file or folder into the terminal window will paste the absolute path into the window. Pro tip 2: Use the tab key to autocomplete unambiguous directory and file names. Hit tab twice to see all ambiguous options. Use arrow-up and arrow-down to repeat previous commands. Or search for previous commands with CTRL + r. A few Git commands: git status is the most used git command and informs you of your current branch, any changes or untracked files, and whether you are in sync with your remotes. git remote -v lists all remotes. Very useful for making sure git knows about your remote and that the remote address is correct. git remote add origin GITHUB_URL adds the remote GITHUB_URL with nickname origin. git remote set-url origin GITHUB_URL changes the remote url of origin to GITHUB_URL. This way you can fix typos in the remote url. we should add more "],
