### Pre-tutorial set-up

**It is vital that you attempt to get your system set up in advance.** These are battle-tested instructions, so most will succeed. We believe in you! If you have trouble, you can open an issue [here](https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r/issues) and we *might* be able to help in the days leading up to useR! (no promises). We will have TAs at the workshop starting at 8:15am.

*insert list of specific pages of set up here!!!*

### What we will do

The tutorial is structured as ~5 task-oriented units. Indicative topics:

  * The most difficult part: installation and configuration!
  * Creating a Git repository and connecting the local repo to a GitHub remote, for new and existing projects.
  * The intersection of GitHub and the R world: R packages developed on Github and how to make use of ["issues"](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/); [METACRAN](http://www.r-pkg.org) [read-only mirror](https://github.com/cran) of all of CRAN; R-specific searching tips.
  * How to propose a change or fix to someone else's project, i.e. "make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)".
  * Daily workflows and FAQ: how often should I commit?, which files should I commit? how do I change a commit or its message? how do groups of 1, 5, or 10 people structure their work with Git(Hub)? etc.
